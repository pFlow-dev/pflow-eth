pflow-eth
=========

Pflow.eth is a Web3 Metamodel Repository.

Embed links to formal models of your smart contract.
Build models with the Solidity Metamodel libraries.

Motivation
----------

We want to compose smart contracts that are Visualizable and Formally verified.
Why not embed the proofs directly in the code?

Status
------
WIP / Alpha


Testing on  Sepolia Testnet: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x33908630f6ee75e05d78cfbfaa4a0e3dc76c8c6e#code


Models
======

TicTacToe
---------

The first example developed in solidity. Compare with an interactive JS model at https://pflow.dev

KonamiCode
----------

A simple example of a petri-net model that can be deployed to Ethereum.
The model is a simple state machine that recognizes the Konami Code.
