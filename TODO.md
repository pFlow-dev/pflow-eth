- [ ] try to build a Metamodel where one of the values is mapped to/from an ERC token address
- [ ] support EIP-1155 standard - attempt to use metamodels as a composable structure where
    - [ ] each sub-token is one element of the state vector for a given metamodel
    - [ ] think of this as a vectorized-token protocol

- [ ] build indexer to ingest on-chain events
